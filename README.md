# Notlib

is now a larger library (originally intended to be smaller) for Minecraft plugins running on PaperMCAPI, supporting version 1.21.4.

## What does this library do?

- This library has simplified the creation of a command using paper-plugin.yml. The user creates the plugin as a NotPlugin, not as a classic plugin. all this is explained in <link to tutorial>
- It can also create GUIs with patterning, animations and other useful features.
- The library already has MySQL and SQLite databases in it, which are then easy to implement.
- It can also do file operations (config.yml etc.)
- It supports sending messages and creating text components using Kyori's Adventure API

There's more to come from this library, but it needs some more time.

In the future, all features will be described using doxygen.
