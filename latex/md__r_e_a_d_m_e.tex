is now a larger library (originally intended to be smaller) for Minecraft plugins running on Paper\+MCAPI, supporting version 1.\+21.\+4.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{What does this library do?}{What does this library do?}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This library has simplified the creation of a command using paper-\/plugin.\+yml. The user creates the plugin as a Not\+Plugin, not as a classic plugin. all this is explained in \href{https://github.com/NotMarra/NotLib/blob/main/examples/command_group.md}{\texttt{ this little tutorial}}
\item It can also create GUIs with patterning, animations and other useful features.
\item The library already has \href{https://github.com/NotMarra/NotLib/blob/main/examples/database.md}{\texttt{ My\+SQL and SQLite databases}} in it, which are then easy to implement.
\item It can also do file operations (config.\+yml etc.)
\item It supports sending messages and creating text components using Kyori\textquotesingle{}s Adventure API
\end{DoxyItemize}

There\textquotesingle{}s more to come from this library, but it needs some more time.

In the future, all features will be described using doxygen.
